# ElderCare Guardian
> Elderly safety and health monitoring wearable — vitals, fall detection, SOS, and caregiver alerts.

**Team:** Pranay · Ariyan · Reman Dey  
**Institution:** IIT Mandi  
**Version:** 1.0.0-beta — Pre-Release  
**Date:** June 2026

## What is this?

ElderCare Guardian is a compact wrist/clip wearable for elderly people living alone or needing light daily monitoring. It streams vitals and motion data to a phone, detects possible falls or distress, and can alert caregivers.

The revised prototype intentionally avoids smart fabric and suit embedding. That makes the build simpler, faster, and more impactful for a showcase: one wearable device, one Android app, one caregiver-focused safety story.

The existing BLE, Samsung Health, simulator, GATT parsing, and Android dashboard work still applies. The product focus changes from fitness intelligence to elderly safety, health trends, and caregiver peace of mind.

├── samsung/          # Samsung Health Data SDK wrapper
├── ml/               # Rule-based engines (ECG, IMU, vitals) + TFLite scaffold

### ML Models *(rule-based; TFLite scaffold prepared in Session 10)*

| Model | Status | Algorithm |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Fall detection | ✅ FallDetectionEngine + FallConfirmationBuffer | Temporal window |
| Caregiver alert triage | ✅ CaregiverAlertPolicy | 4-level triage |
| Inactivity monitoring | ✅ InactivityMonitor | Motion gate |
| ECG anomaly | ✅ EcgAnomalyDetector + HeartRateExtractor | RMSSD + RR intervals |
| Dehydration risk | ✅ DehydrationRiskModel | Tabular rules |
| Vitals risk | ✅ VitalsRiskMonitor | Composite score |
| Overexertion | ✅ OverexertionModel | HR reserve + SpO2 |
| BP estimation | ❌ **Removed from display** | Clinically invalid |
| TFLite models | ⏳ Scaffold exists (`TfLiteFallbackLoader`), no `.tflite` files yet | See `THINGS_LEFT.md` |

### Samsung Health Integration *(reflection bridge active, AAR optional)*

- **Data SDK:** `RealSamsungHealthBridge` uses reflection — always compiles. Transitions: `NeedsSdkAar` → `NeedsPartnerApproval` → `Ready`. No AAR required for build.
- **Accessory SDK:** GATT profile uses standard SIG services (HR 0x180D, PLX 0x1822) for auto-recognition.
